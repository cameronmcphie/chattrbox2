CPSC 473 - Front-End Engineering - Spring 2018
Homework 5
Section 02 - due March 19, Section 01 - due March 21
In this assignment, you will start a new application, Chattrbox, and work with Node.js to build a custom back-end.
Complete the following:
1. Work through Chapter 15 to set up the chattrbox/ directory and create index.js.
2. Complete the Bronze Challenge: Creating a Custom Error Page from Chapter 15.

Load the page from app/error.html, and include the appropriate image from https://http.cat/. 
3. Complete the Silver Challenge: Providing a MIME Type Dynamically from Chapter 15.

When you push this this homework assignment to GitHub, include the files you tested in your app/ subdirectory.
4. Work through Chapter 16 to create websockets-server.js, install wscat, and test the results.
5. Add a /topic command to the chat server to track what users are discussing in the chat. If any user types a string like this:
/topic Chatting about WebSockets
All connected users should receive this string:
*** Topic has changed to 'Chatting about WebSockets'
Users who are not connected should not see this message (i.e., the /topic command should not be saved in the array of previous messages to be sent to each user.)
Instead, the first message that newly connected users should receive is the current topic:
*** Topic is 'Chatting about WebSockets'
Newly connected users should then receive all the previous messages.
   1. Push the contents of your project to a new GitHub repository using a git client (e.g., the git command-line client, GitHub Desktop, or GitHub for Atom). Do not submit files using drag-and-drop onto the repository web page, and do not push this assignment to the same repository as your previous homework assignments.
Submission
Turn in the code for this homework by uploading your chattrbox/ directory to a public repository on GitHub. While you may discuss this homework assignment with other students, the work you submit must have been completed on your own.
